# Image-Captioning
This repository contains an AI-based image caption generator, which utilizes deep learning techniques to generate descriptive captions for images. The model is trained on a large dataset of images and corresponding captions, allowing it to learn the relationship between visual features and textual descriptions.

# How it Works
The image caption generator consists of two main components:

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): This component processes the input image and extracts relevant visual features. A pre-trained CNN, such as ResNet or VGG, is commonly used for this purpose. The CNN acts as an encoder and transforms the image into a fixed-length feature vector.

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): The RNN component takes the feature vector from the CNN and generates a sequence of words to form the caption. It utilizes a type of RNN called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which allows it to capture the context and dependencies between words.

The model is trained using a large dataset of images with their corresponding captions. During training, the CNN and RNN components are jointly optimized to minimize the difference between the predicted captions and the ground truth captions.

# Requirements
